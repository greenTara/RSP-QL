    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Data streams are one of the main sources of information in a wide range of domains and applications, and it is needed to make these streams available at Web scale. For this to become a reality, we need to define Web standards and guidelines on how to produce and consume structured data streams. RDF is a W3C recommendation for structuring and representing data on the Web. However, this model is based on a traditional persisted-data paradigm, where the focus is on maintaining a bounded set of data items in a knowledge base. This paradigm does not fit the case of data streams, where data items flow continuously over time, forming unbounded sequences of data. 
      </p>
      <p>In this context, the W3C RSP Community Group has taken the task to explore the existing technical and theoretical proposals that incorporate streams to the RDF model, and to its query language, SPARQL. More concretely, one of the main goals of the RSP Group is to  define a common but extensible core model for RDF stream processing. It is not the intention of the RSP Group to propose a one-size fits-all model, which is probably infeasible anyway, but rather a base common ground that can serve as a starting point for RSP engines to be able to talk to each other and interoperate.
This document proposes an RDF stream model (data model), and a set of query language features that extend SPARQL for handling data streams (query language). The remainder of the document is structured in three parts. First we state the key requirements for the RSP model. Then we provide a proposal of the data model that extends RDF to support streams. The last part describes the query feature extensions for SPARQL to comprehend the RDF Stream model.
    </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
     
    <p>Requirements for RDF stream processing summarized below are the result of the RSP Group on existing use cases, as well as the needs gathered in extensive existing works of the state of the art. Many of them are also valid for non-RDF systems (Stonebraker et al. 2005) while others come as the result of our individual or joint work on extending RDF for stream processing. The requirements are stated at a high level, and we do not fully detail them as in the use cases. The goal is rather to allow a reader to understand the challenges that RSP systems should be able to address. 
    </p>

    <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>RDF streams should be representable in an abstract model that can be serialized in concrete (standard) formats.</li>
      <li>The RDF Stream should be identifiable with an IRI.</li>
      <li>RDF streams may include different notions of time (timestamps, intervals) with different semantics (application, validity, transactional). In case no timestamp is associated to an RDF stream data item, the system is responsible of managing time-based sequencing.</li>
      <li>RSPs should process streams of data actively and in-stream, without the need of storing them. Systems may optionally store or archive streams but an    RSP should be able to process them applying sequences of operations as they flow over time.</li>
      <li>RSP query engines should support a declarative query language derived from (and compatible with) SPARQL, extended with operators that can consume and produce RDF streams.</li>
      <li>RSP query processing should be able to query only parts of the events or data items in the RDF streams, or only a subset of the streams. -->Query only part of the events (only some of the streaming graphs).</li>
      <li>RSP engines should support registering continuous queries that are evaluated over the RDF streams, producing continuous results. -->Define a query that gets continuously executed</li>
      <li>RSP queries should support combining RDF streams and stored RDF (aka static RDF graphs).</li>
      <li>RSP queries should support the minimal set of features identified in this document. </li>
      <li>The semantics of the RSP data and query model should allow generating predictable results, so that correctness of RSP query process can be evaluated.</li>
    </ol>
  
    
    <h3>Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>The RSP data and query model should be compatible with  RDF (e.g., reads it is as part of the dataset) and SPARQL 1.1 (e.g., uses the same operators and query forms).</li>
      <li>The RDF stream model should be extensible, so to allow different types of time notions (e.g. application time, etc.) using standard vocabularies.</li>
      <li>The RSP query model should allow extensions for specific operators beyond those described in this document (e.g. other types of windows, CEP derived operators, etc).</li>
      <li>The Expression of common query constructs should feel intuitive.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Requirements related to the performance, throughput, efficiency, availability of the system concern the engines that implement this model, rather than the model itself.</p>

<p class="note">How the use cases map to the requirements. An idea may be to identify requirements and number them so that we can relate the use cases to the requirement numbers. In this document or a different one?</p>


<h3>Out of Scope</h3>
 <ol>
      <li>Record a stream.</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>   

    
    <h3>RSP Data model</h3>
    
    <p>The data model for representing RDF streams considers unbounded sequences of data items that flow over time. More specifically, these data items are RDF triples, assembled in graphs, as an event or observation typically requires more than one triple to be represented. Each of these graphs in the sequence respects a particular order, given by time annotations which can be explicit or implicit. This abstract model is detailed below, first describing considerations about the time model, and the  RDF stream model itself.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Order:</strong> The partial order must respect the natural order of time. In particular, if every time instant within the closure of temporal entity <code>X</code> is earlier than every time instant within the closure of temporal entity <code>Y</code>, then <code>X &lt;= Y</code> (where closure of a time instant <code>t</code> is defined as the degenerate interval <code>[t, t]</code>, and closure of an interval is defined in the usual way) </p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, the usual mathematical requirements of a partial order apply:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>a) Reflexivity <code>X &lt;= X</code></li>
      <li>b) Antisymmetry <code>X &lt;= Y</code> and <code>Y &lt;= X</code> implies <code>X = Y</code></li>
      <li>c) Transitivity <code>X &lt;= Y</code> and <code>Y &lt;= Z</code> implies <code>X &lt;= Z</code>. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>On the following we may refer to RDF stream simply as stream.</p>
    
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    
    <p>A stream produces data that indicates where a person is at a given time. The <code>p</code> predicate used in this example is the PROV `<code>prov:generatedAtTime</code>. In this example the named graphs (<code>:g1</code>,<code>:g2</code>, etc.) contain the streaming data contents (for brevity the contents are represented by the dots <code>...</code>). </p>
    
    <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream Abbreviated"><code>:g1 {...}{:g1,prov:generatedAtTime,t1}
:g2 {...}{:g2,prov:generatedAtTime,t2}
:g3 {...}{:g3,prov:generatedAtTime,t3}
:g4 {...}{:g4,prov:generatedAtTime,t4}
...
</code></pre>
    
    <p>We can expand the content of each named graph, which is a set of triples:</p>
    
    <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream Expanded"><code>:g1 {:axel :isIn :RedRoom. :darko :isIn :RedRoom} {:g1,prov:generatedAtTime,t1}
:g2 {:axel :isIn :BlueRoom. }                     {:g2,prov:generatedAtTime,t2}
:g3 {:minh :isIn :RedRoom. }                      {:g3,prov:generatedAtTime,t3}
...
</code></pre>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Given a certain <code>p</code>, elements on the stream having that predicate are ordered according to <code>t</code>. If the stream contains elements s1 and s2 associated with the same predicate, with s1 preceding s2, then it should not be the case that the timestamp of s1 is greater than the timestamp of s2.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p><strong>Observation:</strong> There can be multiple graphs with the same timestamp in the stream.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>It has been pointed out that this statement might be problematic, as graphs cold no longer be used for punctuation purposes. Comparatively, we have not found a constraint on this in similar models e.g. CQL: <em>there could be zero, one, or multiple elements with the same timestamp in a stream</em>. To verify.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h3>Substream</h3>
    
    <p>A <em>substream</em> (also known as window) <code>S'</code> of a stream <code>S</code> is a subsequence of <code>S</code>.</p>
    
    <h4>Time-bounded Substream</h4>
    
    <p>A <em>time-bounded substream</em> is defined by two time instances providing a lower bound <code>t_l</code> and an upper bound <code>t_u</code> where <code>t_l &lt;= t_u</code>. A timestamped graph <code>(g_i,p_i,t_i)</code> is in the time-bounded substream if and only if <code>t_l &lt;= t_i &lt;= t_u</code>.</p>
    
    <h4>Count-bounded Substream</h4>
    
    <p>A <em>count-bounded substream</em> is defined by a time instance <code>t</code> and an integer value <code>n</code> that represents the number of timestamped graphs to include in the count-bounded substream. The count-bounded substream consists of the <code>n</code> timestamped graphs at or before time instance <code>t</code>. That is, a timestamped graph <code>(g_i,p_i,t_i)</code> is in the count-bounded substream if and only if there are less than or equal to <code>n</code> timestamped graphs between it and the time instance <code>t</code>.</p>
    
    <p  class="note">A bounded substream maintains the timestamped graph contexts of the original stream.</p>

    <h2>Window Functions</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p  class="note">Window operator is reserved for later use to return time-varying graphs. Window functions work on a time instant. </p>
      
      <p class="note">In the following, we take the case where temporal entities in the stream are time instants.</p>
      
      <p>Open Issue: <a href="https://github.com/streamreasoning/RSP-QL/issues/18">Issue 18</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A <em>window function</em> <code>w<sub>ι</sub></code> of type <code>ι</code> takes as input a stream <code>S</code>, a predicate <code>p</code>, a time instant <code>t</code>, called the reference time point, and a vector of window parameters <code>x</code> for type <code>ι</code> and returns a substream <code>S'</code> of <code>S</code> that contains only timestamped graphs associated with <code>p</code> and timestamps valid at <code>t</code> according <code>ι</code> and <code>x</code>.</p>
    
    <p>The most common types of windows in practice are time-based and count-based. We associate them with the window functions <code>w<sub>τ</sub></code>, <code>w<sub>#</sub></code>, respectively. They take a fixed size ranging back in time from a reference time point <code>t</code>. These functions work as follows.</p>
    
    <h3>Time-based window functions</h3>
    
    <p><code>x = (l,d)</code>, where <code>l ∈ N ∪ {∞}</code> and <code>d ∈ N</code>. The function <code>w<sub>τ</sub>(S,p,t,x)</code> returns the substream of S that contains all timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> of the last <code>l</code> time units relative to a pivot time point <code>t'</code> derived from <code>t</code> and the step size <code>d</code> (Todo: MD: a figure to illustrate). We use <code>l = ∞</code> to take all previous timestamped graphs.</p>
    
    <p>Formally:</p>
    
    <p><code>w<sub>τ</sub>(S,p,t,(l,d)) = {((n,g),p,t<sub>1</sub>)∈ S ∣ t'-l &lt; t<sub>1</sub> ≤ t'}</code>, </p>
    
    <p>where <code>t'= ⌊t/d⌋ \cdot d</code></p>
    
    <h3>Count-based window functions</h3>
    
    <p><code>x = (l)</code>, where <code>l ∈ N</code>. The function <code>w<sub>#</sub>(S,p,t,x)</code> selects a substream <code>S<sub>1</sub></code> of <code>S</code> based on the time instant <code>t'</code> satisfying that:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>for every <code>t' &lt; t'' ≤ t</code>, there are fewer than <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t''</code> to <code>t</code>,</li>
      <li>there are at least <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t'</code> to <code>t</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Elements from <code>S<sub>1</sub></code> are those <code>((n<sub>i</sub>,g<sub>i</sub>),p,t<sub>i</sub>)</code> from <code>S</code> having <code>t<sub>i</sub> ≥ t'</code>. In case there are more than <code>l</code> timestamped graphs associated with predicate <code>p</code> in <code>S</code> from <code>t'</code> to <code>t</code>, only timestamped graphs at <code>t'</code> are removed at random.</p>
    
    <p>Formally:</p>
    
    <p><code>w<sub>#</sub>(S,p,t,(l)) = {((n,g),p,t'') ∈ S ∣ t' &lt; t'' ≤ t} ∪ X(S|<sub>p</sub>[t',t'], l - #S|<sub>p</sub>[t'+1,t])</code>,</p>
    
    <p>where</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>S|<sub>p</sub>[t<sub>1</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>] = {((n,g),p,t'') ∈ S ∣ t<sub>1</sub> ≤ t'' ≤ t<sub>2</sub>}</code>,</li>
      <li><code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t<sub>1</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>]</code> is the number of elements of this set,</li>
      <li><code>t'</code> satisfies that <code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t',t] ≥ l</code> and <code>#S|<sub>p</sub>[t'+1,t] &lt; l</code> </li>

:g_1, :endsAt, "2015-06-18T13:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime
</code></pre>
      
      <p>Or even:</p>
      
      <pre  class="example highlight" title="RDF Stream with Interval Timestamp"><code>:g_2 :validBetween
    [:startsAt "2015-06-18T12:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
    :endsAt "2015-06-18T13:00:00"^^xsd:dateTime]
</code></pre>
